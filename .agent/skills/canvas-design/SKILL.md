# Canvas Design Skill

Create visual designs with distinctive aesthetic philosophies for Android applications.

## When This Skill Applies

Activate when creating:
- App icons and launcher icons
- Splash screen artwork
- Promotional graphics (Play Store screenshots, feature graphics)
- In-app illustrations and decorative elements
- Marketing materials for mobile apps
- Poster-style designs

## Workflow

Complete this in two steps:
1. **Design Philosophy Creation** (.md file)
2. **Express by creating it on a canvas** (.pdf or .png file)

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CREATION

Create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY that will be interpreted through:
- Form, space, color, composition
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Minimal text as visual accent

### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING
- **What is received**: Subtle input from user as a foundation (not a constraint)
- **What is created**: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement
- **What happens next**: The philosophy is EXPRESSED VISUALLY - 90% visual design, 10% essential text

### How to Generate a Visual Philosophy

1. Write a manifesto for an art movement
2. Express it visually on a canvas

**Philosophy Format**:
```markdown
# [PHILOSOPHY NAME]
[2-3 sentence manifesto describing the aesthetic movement]

## Visual Expression
- [Key visual element 1]
- [Key visual element 2]
- [Key visual element 3]

## Color Philosophy
[Description of color approach and palette]

## Form Language
[Description of shapes, patterns, compositions]
```

### Philosophy Examples

| Philosophy | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Brutalist Clarity** | Raw, honest forms with high contrast and bold geometry |
| **Organic Flow** | Natural curves, soft gradients, biomorphic shapes |
| **Geometric Precision** | Mathematical harmony, grid-based compositions |
| **Material Depth** | Layered surfaces, subtle shadows, tactile textures |
| **Minimalist Void** | Essential elements only, generous negative space |

### Essential Principles

1. **Develop a unique aesthetic philosophy** - not just style choices, but a coherent worldview
2. **Express the philosophy visually** - every element should reinforce the philosophy
3. **Create with extreme craftsmanship** - museum-quality execution
4. **Minimal text** - visual expression trumps words

## CANVAS CREATION

After establishing the philosophy, create the visual design:

### Technical Requirements

- Output as **.png** (for app assets) or **.pdf** (for print/documentation)
- Use appropriate dimensions for the target use case:
  - App Icon: 512x512px (adaptive icon)
  - Splash Screen: 1080x1920px (portrait) or 1920x1080px (landscape)
  - Feature Graphic: 1024x500px
  - Screenshots: Various resolutions per device

### Android-Specific Considerations

- **Adaptive Icons**: Design for both circular and squircle masks
- **Material Design Compatibility**: Consider how design works with Material 3
- **Dark Mode**: Create variants for both light and dark themes
- **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast ratios

### Craftsmanship Requirements

- Expert-level composition, spacing, and color choices
- Nothing overlaps unintentionally
- Formatting is flawless
- Every detail is considered

---

## FINAL STEP

**IMPORTANT**: The work must be pristine - as if about to be displayed in a museum.

**CRITICAL**: To refine the work:
- Avoid adding more graphics
- Refine what exists to be crisp
- Respect the design philosophy
- Ask: "How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?"

Take a second pass. Polish further to create a philosophically designed masterpiece.

---

## MULTI-PAGE/VARIANT OPTION

When requested, create additional variants:
- Light/Dark theme versions
- Different aspect ratios
- Animation keyframes
- Progressive complexity levels

Each variant should be a unique twist while maintaining the original philosophy.
