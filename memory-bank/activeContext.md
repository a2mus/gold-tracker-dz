## Current Focus
Rebuilding the scraper architecture to be resilient and capable of backfilling historical data. We are moving away from ad-hoc fixes to a specified, engineered solution.

## Recent Changes

## Open Questions
- How to robustly handle Telegram auth (User vs Bot) in a headless container?
- Best strategy for historical backfill (Web preview parsing vs Telethon history)?
