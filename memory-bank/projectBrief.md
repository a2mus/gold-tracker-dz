# Project Brief

## Overview
Gold Tracker DZ is a platform to track real-time and historical gold prices in the Algerian parallel market (Square/Local). It scrapes data from Telegram channels (like @bijouteriechalabi) and presents it via a modern dashboard.

## Goals
- Provide accurate, real-time gold prices (18k, 21k, 22k, 24k).
- Maintain historical data for trend analysis.
- Automate data collection via resilient scrapers.

## Constraints
- Telegram anti-scraping/auth limits.
- VPS resource limits (Contabo).
